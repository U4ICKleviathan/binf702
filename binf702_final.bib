  abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study was to gain insight into the pathophysiological significance of elevated plasma glucose concentrations (mmol/L) 60\,min post oral glucose load in apparently healthy individuals. METHODS: Comparison of resistance to insulin action and associated cardio-metabolic risk factors in 490 apparently healthy persons, subdivided into those with a plasma glucose concentration 60\,min following a 75-g oral glucose challenge of {$<$}8.6 versus ⩾8.6. RESULTS: Insulin resistance was significantly greater in persons with normal glucose tolerance whose 60-min glucose concentration was ⩾8.6, associated with higher blood pressure, plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, triglyceride and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Similar differences were seen in persons with impaired fasting glucose, but not in those with impaired glucose tolerance or both impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. The group whose 60-min glucose was {$<$}8.6 (n\,=\,318) contained primarily persons with normal glucose tolerance (88\%), whereas the majority of those whose 60-min value was ⩾8.6 (n\,=\,172) had prediabetes (59\%) and in particular combined impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. CONCLUSION: Plasma glucose concentration of ⩾8.6 mmol/L 60 min post oral glucose identifies higher proportions of combined impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance individuals as well as normal glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose individuals with a more adverse cardio-metabolic profile, contributing to observed increased overall risk of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To study the inheritance pattern of diabetes mellitus in Western Indian population by analysing the pedigree of diabetes patients. METHODS: 3,921 individuals from 300 families were interviewed for family history in this study, out of which 770 were diabetic individuals. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using T-test and Chi-square test. RESULTS: 37\% cases of Type 1 DM and 58\% cases of Type 2 DM showed family history of the disease. Of the cases showing family history for diabetes, 92\% in case of Type 1 DM and 59\% in case of Type 2 DM showed family history of Type 2 DM with a decrease in age of onset in the successive generations. Both the parents, when diabetic conferred equal risk of inheriting diabetes in offspring. The sex ratio of offspring suffering from diabetes was not influenced when only one of the parents was diabetic. However it was observed that the male offspring were highly susceptible when both parents were diabetic (Chi-square value=4.55 with 1 d.f.). The age of onset of diabetes did not show significant correlation with whether one or both the parents were diabetic. However, it was noteworthy that in case of familial history of diabetes there was a decrease in the age of onset in successive generations. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that family history of diabetes results in predisposition to early onset of the disease in successive generations and a cluster of genes involved in Type 2 DM may show a parental effect for predisposition to Type 1 DM in the offspring in this set of Indian population.},

  abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: In addition to blood glucose concentrations measured in the fasting state and 2~h after an OGTT, intermediate measures during an OGTT may provide additional information regarding a person's risk of future diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). First, we aimed to characterise heterogeneity of glycaemic patterns based on three time points during an OGTT. Second, we compared the incidences of diabetes and CVD and all-cause mortality rates among those with different patterns. METHODS: Our cohort study included 5861 participants without diabetes at baseline from the Danish Inter99 study. At baseline, all participants underwent an OGTT with measurements of plasma glucose levels at 0, 30 and 120~min. Latent class mixed-effects models were fitted to identify distinct patterns of glycaemic response during the OGTT. Information regarding incident diabetes, CVD and all-cause mortality rates during a median follow-up time of 11, 12 and 13~years, respectively, was extracted from national registers. Cox proportional hazard models with adjustment for several cardiometabolic risk factors were used to compare the risk of diabetes, CVD and all-cause mortality among individuals in the different latent classes. RESULTS: Four distinct glucose patterns during the OGTT were identified. One pattern was characterised by high 30~min but low 2~h glucose values. Participants with this pattern had an increased risk of developing diabetes compared with participants with lower 30~min and 2~h glucose levels (HR 4.1 [95\% CI 2.2, 7.6]) and participants with higher 2~h but lower 30~min glucose levels (HR 1.5 [95\% CI 1.0, 2.2]). Furthermore, the all-cause mortality rate differed between the groups with significantly higher rates in the two groups with elevated 30~min glucose. Only small non-significant differences in risk of future CVD were observed across latent classes after confounder adjustment. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Elevated 30~min glucose is associated with increased risk of diabetes and all-cause mortality rate independent of fasting and 2~h glucose levels. Therefore, subgroups at high risk may not be revealed when considering only fasting and 2~h glucose levels during an OGTT.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To create a simple prediction rule that could perform as well as the 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose (PCPG) test to predict those at risk for diabetes. We created a prediction rule in one sample and prospectively validated it for incident diabetes in a separate cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis with data from the Rancho Bernardo Study (age 67 +/- 11 years) to derive a rule predicting abnormal PCPG {$>$}/=140 mg/dl, using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of nondiabetic participants with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) {$<$}126 mg/dl. Data from the Health, Aging and Body Composition study (age 74 +/- 3 years) were used to prospectively validate this rule for incident diabetes and compare it with the predictive ability of the PCPG test. RESULTS: Of 1,549 RBS participants, 514 (33\%) had PCPG {$>$}/=140 mg/dl. Female sex, age, triglycerides, and FPG were most significantly associated with abnormal PCPG. Based on standardized beta-coefficients, we allotted 1 point for female sex, triglycerides {$>$}/=150 mg/dl, or FPG 95-104 mg/dl. Age {$>$}/=70 years or FPG 105-115 mg/dl were given 2 points, and FPG 116-125 mg/dl received 3 points. In the validation cohort, this simple prediction rule was as good as the 2-h PCPG test for predicting incident diabetes (C-statistic: 0.71 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, female sex, FPG, and triglycerides were able to predict adults at risk for diabetes equally well as the 2-h PCPG test. Using this rule, clinicians may better identify older persons who should receive intensive lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether the number of pregnancies during childbearing age was associated with diabetes in postmenopausal women with no history of gestational diabetes. METHODS: Our data source was the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2014. We selected 9,138 postmenopausal women over 40 years old who did not have a history of gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Logistic regression analyses were applied for the association of the number of pregnancies with diabetes. RESULTS: We found women with ≥4 pregnancies had significantly greater fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 2-hour plasma glucose, and the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance than those with two to three pregnancies (all P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.01). These women also had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes (28.4\% vs 20.7\%; P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001). Using the two to three pregnancies group as the reference, we observed a positive association of log-FPG and log-HbA1c with 4 or more pregnancies after adjustment for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors, and body mass index (both P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.05). Compared to women with two to three pregnancies, the odds ratios for diabetes were 1.31 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.71) for women who never got pregnant and 1.28 (95\% CI 1.10-1.48) for those with at least 4 pregnancies after multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: At least 4 pregnancies through childbearing age may be a potential risk factor for diabetes in postmenopausal women without a history of gestational diabetes.},

RESULTS: The prevalence rates of T2DM and impaired glucose regulation (IGR) was 47.62\%, including 218 T2DM and 422 IGR newly discovered. The prevalence rates of T2DM and IGR were 38.33\% and 14.25\% in the siblings, and 56.81\% and 12.58\% in the parents, all significantly higher than those in the second-degree relatives (9.55\% and 6.10\%) and spouses (10.57\% and 9.55\% respectively, all P {$<$} 0.01). The prevalence and newly discovered rates of IGR in the offspring were 12.46\% and 11.73\% respectively, both significantly higher than those in the spouses (9.55\% and 9.55\% respectively, all P {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSION: There is significant familial aggregation in T2DM. The first-degree relatives of T2DM patients are high risk populations, so long term monitoring and early screening should be performed.},

  abstract = {Aims/hypothesis In women, higher parity has been associated with increased risk of diabetes later in life. It is unclear, however, whether this association is mainly due to biological effects of childbearing, or to socioeconomic and lifestyle factors associated with childrearing. We assessed the association between number of children and diabetes risk separately in women and men. Methods Between 2004 and 2008, the nationwide China Kadoorie Biobank recruited 0.5 million individuals aged 30–79 (mean 51~years) from ten diverse regions across China. During 7~years of follow-up, 8,840 incident cases of diabetes were recorded among 463,347 participants without prior cardiovascular diseases or diabetes. Multivariable Cox regression yielded sex-specific HRs and 95\% CIs for incident diabetes by number of children. Results Overall, ∼98\% of all participants had children. In women, there was a J-shaped association between number of children and risk of diabetes. Compared with women with one child, the adjusted HRs for diabetes were 1.39 (95\% CI 1.11, 1.73) for childless women, 1.12 (95\% CI 1.07, 1.18) for those with two children, 1.23 (95\% CI 1.16, 1.31) for those with three children, and 1.32 (95\% CI 1.21, 1.44) for those with four or more children. In men, there was a similar association with risk of diabetes; the corresponding HRs were 1.28 (95\% CI 1.02, 1.60), 1.19 (95\% CI 1.12, 1.26), 1.32 (95\% CI 1.21, 1.44) and 1.41 (95\% CI 1.24, 1.60), respectively. In both sexes, the findings were broadly similar in different population subgroups. Conclusions/interpretation The similarity between women and men in the association between number of children and risk of diabetes suggests that parenthood is most likely to affect diabetes risk through factors associated with childrearing rather than via biological effects of childbearing.

  abstract = {Metabolic disorders, such as obesity, elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemias, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia have all been identified as risk factors for an epidemic of important and widespread chronic-degenerative diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, that constitute some of the world's most important public health challenges. Their increasing prevalence can be associated with an aging population and to lifestyles within an obesogenic environment. Taking educational level as a proxy for lifestyle, and using both logistic and linear regressions, we study the relation between a wide set of metabolic biomarkers, and educational level, body mass index (BMI), age, and sex as correlates, in a population of 1,073 students, academic and non-academic staff at Mexico's largest university (UNAM). Controlling for BMI and sex, we consider educational level and age as complementary measures—degree and duration—of exposure to metabolic insults. Analyzing the role of education across a wide spectrum of educational levels (from primary school to doctoral degree), we show that higher education correlates to significantly better metabolic health when compared to lower levels, and is associated with significantly less risk for waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein and metabolic syndrome (all p {$<$} 0.05); but not for diastolic blood pressure, basal insulin, uric acid, low density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol. We classify each biomarker, and corresponding metabolic disorder, by its associated set of statistically significant correlates. Differences among the sets of significant correlates indicate various aetiologies and the need for targeted population-specific interventions. Thus, variables strongly linked to educational level are candidates for lifestyle change interventions. Hence, public policy efforts should be focused on those metabolic biomarkers strongly linked to education, while adopting a different approach for those biomarkers not linked as they may be poor targets for educational campaigns.},
