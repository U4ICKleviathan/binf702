# 1. Binomial distribution. Let X be binomially distributed with n = 60 and p = 0.4. Compute the following.


#### (a) $$P(X = 24) $$
```{r}

dbinom(x=24, size = 60, prob = 0.4)
```
#### $$P(X ≤ 24)$$

```{r}
sum(dbinom(x=1:24, size = 60, prob = 0.4))

```

#### and $$P(X ≥ 30)$$

```{r}

1-sum(dbinom(x=1:29, size = 60, prob = 0.4))

```
#### (b) $$P(20 ≤ X ≤ 30)$$
```{r}

sum(dbinom(x=20:30, size = 60, prob = 0.4))
```
#### $$P(20 ≤ X)$$
```{r}

sum(dbinom(x=1:20, size = 60, prob = 0.4))
```


#### (c) $$P(20 ≤ X or X ≥ 40)$$

```{r}

sum(dbinom(x=1:20, size = 60, prob = 0.4)) - (1-sum(dbinom(x=1:40, size = 60, prob = 0.4)))

```
