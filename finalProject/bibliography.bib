  abstract = {About 50\% of patients presenting with resectable lung cancer develop distant metastases within 5 years. Genomic markers predicting metastatic behaviour of squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC) are currently underexposed. We analyzed a cohort of patients with primary SCC using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to identify which genomic aberrations are related to metastatic behaviour. The cohort consisted of 34 patients with a follow-up of at least 5 years, 8 with metastases in regional lymph nodes only and 26 patients without any metastases at the time of surgery. Eleven of the latter 26 developed metastases in distant organs within 3 years after surgery. Copy number changes observed in at least 40\% of all SCC included gains at chromosomal arms 3q, 5p, 8q, 19q, 20p, 22q and losses at 3p, 4p, 4q, 5q, 8p and 9p. High copy number amplifications were observed at 2p15-p16, 3q24-q29, 8p11-p12, 8q23-q24, and 12p12, containing candidate oncogenes such as BCL11A, REL, ECT2, PIK3CA, ADAM9, MYC and KRAS. Amplification of 2p15-p16 is a novel finding in SCC. Another novel finding is the homozygous deletion observed at 4q33-34.1 in 15\% of the SCC cases. Gains at 7q36, 8p12, 10q22, 12p12, loss at 4p14 and the homozygous deletions at 4q occurred significantly more frequent in SCC from patients with lymph node metastases only. SCC from patients with distant metastases showed a significantly higher gain frequency at 8q22-q24 and loss at 8p23 and 13q21, and a significantly lower gain frequency at 2p12 and 2p16 and loss at 11q25 compared with SCC from patients without metastases. Of these, gains at 7q, 8p and 10q were restricted to SCC with lymph node metastasis and gain at 8q was restricted to patients with distant metastasis. Two genomic aberrations, i.e. loss of 4p and gain of 19q12 were observed more frequently in SCC with only lymph node metastases as compared to SCC with distant metastases. In conclusion, we identified genomic aberrations in primary SCC that were related to lymph node or distant metastases.},

This study aimed to explore the role of RNF19A, as well as the underlying potential mechanism, in the development of NSCLC. Here, we found that RNF19A was overexpressed in NSCLC tissues, and RNF19A expression in NSCLC tissue samples was associated with NSCLC carcinogenesis and poor outcome. RNF19A promoted the proliferation of NSCLC cells and inhibited apoptosis. RNF19A reduced p53, p21 and BAX expression and induced Cyclin D1, CDK4, CDK6 and BCL2 expression. The inhibitory effect of RNF19A knockdown on proliferation was partially rescued by p53 silencing. RNF19A interacted with p53, shortened p53 half‐life and mediated p53 ubiquitin‐degradation. Collectively, we suggest that RNF19A plays a critical oncogenic role in lung carcinogenesis by disrupting the function of p53. RNF19A may serve as a new biomarker and/or target for NSCLC management.},

Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Gleason score (GS) is one of the best predictors of PCa aggressiveness, but additional tumor biomarkers may improve its prognostic accuracy. We developed a gene expression signature of GS to enhance the prediction of PCa outcomes. Elastic net was used to construct a gene expression signature by contrasting GS 8-10 vs. ≤6 tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The constructed signature was then evaluated for its ability to predict recurrence and metastatic-lethal (ML) progression in a Fred Hutchinson (FH) patient cohort (N=408; NRecurrence=109; NMLprogression=27). The expression signature included transcripts representing 49 genes. In the FH cohort, a 25\% increase in the signature was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.51 (P=2.7×10−5) for recurrence. The signature's area under the curve (AUC) for predicting recurrence and ML progression was 0.68 and 0.76, respectively. Compared to a model with age at diagnosis, pathological stage and GS, the gene expression signature improved the AUC for recurrence (3\%) and ML progression (6\%). Higher levels of the signature were associated with increased expression of genes in cell cycle-related pathways and decreased expression of genes in androgen response, estrogen response, oxidative phosphorylation, and apoptosis. This gene expression signature based on GS may improve the prediction of recurrence as well as ML progression in PCa patients after radical prostatectomy.},

  abstract = {Cancer arises through accumulation of epigenetic and genetic alteration. Aberrant promoter methylation is a common epigenetic mechanism of gene silencing in cancer cells. We here performed genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation of promoter regions by Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, using 14 clinical papillary thyroid cancer samples and 10 normal thyroid samples. Among the 14 papillary cancer cases, 11 showed frequent aberrant methylation, but the other three cases showed no aberrant methylation at all. Distribution of the hypermethylation among cancer samples was non-random, which implied existence of a subset of preferentially methylated papillary thyroid cancer. Among 25 frequently methylated genes, methylation status of six genes (HIST1H3J, POU4F2, SHOX2, PHKG2, TLX3, HOXA7) was validated quantitatively by pyrosequencing. Epigenetic silencing of these genes in methylated papillary thyroid cancer cell lines was confirmed by gene re-expression following treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A, and detected by real-time RT-PCR. Methylation of these six genes was validated by analysis of additional 20 papillary thyroid cancer and 10 normal samples. Among the 34 cancer samples in total, 26 cancer samples with preferential methylation were significantly associated with mutation of BRAF/RAS oncogene (P = 0.04, Fisher's exact test). Thus, we identified new genes with frequent epigenetic hypermethylation in papillary thyroid cancer, two subsets of either preferentially methylated or hardly methylated papillary thyroid cancer, with a concomitant occurrence of oncogene mutation and gene methylation. These hypermethylated genes may constitute potential biomarkers for papillary thyroid cancer.},

Except for its expression and potential role in spermatogenesis, the function of SPAG1 is completely unknown. The unexpected finding of high levels of SPAG1 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared to normal pancreatic tissue in our previous cDNA array experiments prompted us to look in more detail at the expression and role of this gene in a panel of normal and malignant human tissues as well as in a larger series of pancreatic cancer specimens. We have generated an SPAG1-specific monoclonal antibody and showed high levels of SPAG1 protein in testis and in a large proportion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). In the latter, SPAG1 expression was predominantly cytoplasmic and confined to malignant cells. Furthermore, the extent and intensity of SPAG1 expression was shown to be associated with stage and tumour nodal status, while analysis of precursor lesions, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), demonstrated its increased immunoreactivity with increasing PanIN grade, suggesting that SPAG1 is a novel marker of PDAC progression. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated colocalization of SPAG1 with microtubules, and their association was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation; subsequent motility assays further substantiated a potential role of SPAG1 in cancer cell motility. Combined with the finding of its early expression in PDAC development, our data suggest that SPAG1 could contribute to the early spread and poor prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.},

Although the overall incidence of and mortality from prostate cancer has been declining in White men since 1991, the decline in African American men lags behind White men. Of particular concern is the growing literature on the disproportionate burden of prostate cancer among other Black men of West African ancestry in the Caribbean Islands, United Kingdom and West Africa. This higher incidence of prostate cancer observed in populations of African descent may be attributed to the fact that these populations share ancestral genetic factors.

  abstract = {The small GTPase Ral is known to be highly activated in several human cancers, such as bladder, colon and pancreas cancers. It is reported that activated Ral is involved in cell proliferation, migration and metastasis of bladder cancer. This protein is activated by Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs) and inactivated by Ral GTPase-activating proteins (RalGAPs), the latter of which consist of heterodimers containing a catalytic α1 or α2 subunit and a common β subunit. In Ras-driven cancers, such as pancreas and colon cancers, constitutively active Ras mutant activates Ral through interaction with RalGEFs, which contain the Ras association domain. However, little is known with regard to the mechanism that governs aberrant activation of Ral in bladder cancer, in which Ras mutations are relatively infrequent. Here, we show that Ral was highly activated in invasive bladder cancer cells due to reduced expression of RalGAPα2, the dominant catalytic subunit in bladder, rather than increased expression of RalGEFs. Exogenous expression of wild-type RalGAPα2 in KU7 bladder cancer cells with invasive phenotype, but not mutant RalGAPα2-N1742K lacking RalGAP activity, resulted in attenuated cell migration in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, genetic ablation of Ralgapa2 promoted tumor invasion in a chemically-induced murine bladder cancer model. Importantly, immunohistochemical analysis of human bladder cancer specimens revealed that lower expression of RalGAPα2 was associated with advanced clinical stage and poor survival of patients. Collectively, these results are highly indicative that attenuated expression of RalGAPα2 leads to disease progression of bladder cancer through enhancement of Ral activity.},

  abstract = {The present study aimed to identify the genes associated with the involvement of adjunct lymph nodes of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and to provide valuable information for the identification of potential diagnostic biomarkers and pathological genes in PCa metastasis. The most important candidate genes were identified through several machine learning approaches including K-means clustering, neural network, Naïve Bayesian classifications and PCA with or without downsampling. In total, 21 genes associated with lymph nodes involvement were identified. Among them, nine genes have been identified in metastatic prostate cancer, six have been found in the other metastatic cancers and four in other local cancers. The amplification of the candidate genes was evaluated in the other PCa datasets. Besides, we identified a validated set of genes involved in the PCa metastasis. The amplification of SPAG1 and PLEKHF2 genes were associated with decreased survival in patients with PCa.},

  abstract = {Mutations in SPAG1, a dynein axonemal assembly factor (DNAAF) that facilitates the assembly of dynein arms in the cytoplasm before their transport into the cilium, result in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetically heterogenous disorder characterized by chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease, infertility and laterality defects. To further elucidate the role of SPAG1 in dynein assembly, we examined its expression, interactions and ciliary defects in control and PCD human airway epithelia. Immunoprecipitations showed that SPAG1 interacts with multiple DNAAFs, dynein chains and canonical components of the R2TP complex. Protein levels of dynein heavy chains (DHCs) and interactions between DHCs and dynein intermediate chains (DICs) were reduced in SPAG1 mutants. We also identified a previously uncharacterized 60\hspace{0.25em}kDa SPAG1 isoform, through examination of PCD subjects with an atypical ultrastructural defect for SPAG1 variants, that can partially compensate for the absence of full-length SPAG1 to assemble a reduced number of outer dynein arms. In summary, our data show that SPAG1 is necessary for axonemal dynein arm assembly by scaffolding R2TP-like complexes composed of several DNAAFs that facilitate the folding and/or binding of the DHCs to the DIC complex.},

  abstract = {RalA and RalB are small GTPases which support malignant development and progression in experimental models of bladder, prostate and squamous cancer. However, demonstration of their clinical relevance in human tumors remains lacking. Here, we developed tools to evaluate Ral protein expression, activation and transcriptional output and evaluated their association with clinicopathologic parameters in common human tumor types. In order to evaluate the relevance of Ral activation and transcriptional output, we correlated RalA and RalB activation with the mutational status of key human bladder cancer genes. We also identified and evaluated a “transcriptional signature” of genes that correlates with depletion of RalA and RalB in vivo. The Ral transcriptional signature score, but not protein expression as evaluated by immunohistochemistry, predicted disease stage, progression to muscle invasion, and survival in human bladder cancers, and metastatic and stem cell phenotypes in bladder cancer models. In prostate cancer, the Ral transcriptional signature score was associated with seminal vesicle invasion, androgen-independent progression, and reduced survival. In squamous cell carcinoma, this score was decreased in cancer tissues compared with normal mucosa, validating the experimental findings that Ral acts as a tumor-suppressor in this tumor type. Together, our findings demonstrate the clinical relevance of Ral in human cancer and provide a rationale for the development of Ral-directed therapies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Zao-Jiao-Ci (ZJC), a traditional Chinese medicine, is considered as a promising candidate to treat laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. METHODS: Gene expression profiles of GSE36668 were available from the GEO database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of LSCC were obtained by R package; subsequently, enrichment analysis on KEGG and GO of DEGs was performed. The active ingredients of ZJC were screened from the TCMSP database, and the matched candidate targets were obtained by PharmMapper. Furthermore, we constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of DEGs and candidate targets, respectively, and we screened the core network from the merged network through combining the two PPI networks using Cytoscape 3.7.2. The key targets derived from the core network were analyzed to find out the associated KEGG signal enrichment pathway. By the GEPIA online website, Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to complete the overall survival and disease-free survival of the selected genes in the core module. RESULTS: We identified 96 candidate targets of ZJC and 86 DEGs of LSCC, the latter including 50 upregulated genes and 36 downregulated genes. DEGs were obviously enriched in the following biological functions: extracellular structure organization, the extracellular matrix organization, and endodermal cell differentiation. The 60 key targets from the core network were enriched in the signal pathways including transcriptional misregulation cancer, cell cycle, and so on. We found that LSCC patients with high expression of HIST1H3J, HIST1H3F, and ITGA4 had worse overall survival, while higher expression of NTRK1, COPS5, HIST1H3A, and HIST1H3G had significantly worse disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: It suggested that the interaction between ZJC and LSCC was related to the signal pathways of transcriptional misregulation cancer and cell cycle, revealing that it may be the mechanism of ZJC in the treatment of LSCC.},
